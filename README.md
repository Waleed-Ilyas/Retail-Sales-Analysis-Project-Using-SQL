# 🚀 Excited to Share My Latest SQL Project on Retail Sales! 🚀

In this project, I leveraged my SQL skills to tackle real-world business questions related to retail sales. From setting up a retail sales database to performing exploratory data analysis (EDA) and answering specific business queries, this project demonstrates the practical application of SQL in data analysis.

## 🔍 Project Highlights:

➤ Database Setup: Created and populated a retail sales database with sales data.

➤ Data Cleaning: Identified and removed records with missing or null values to ensure data quality.

➤ Exploratory Data Analysis: Conducted basic EDA to gain insights into the dataset.

➤ Business Analysis: Answered key business questions using SQL queries, such as:

● Retrieving sales data for specific dates and categories.

● Calculating total sales, average customer age, and transaction counts.

● Identifying top-performing customers and sales trends by month.
